				<p>From May 1914 to April 1928, there was no name of the editor mentioned. Towards the end of the April 1926 issue, page 478 it was mentioned in the News and Reports.</p>
				<div class="bquoteOpen">&nbsp;</div>
				<p class="bquote gapAbove">Swami Sharvananda who has been the President of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission in&nbsp;Madras since 1911 and has been editing the&nbsp;Vedanta Kesari&nbsp;from its very start is retiring from work after nineteen years of strenuous labour. He means to lead at present a life of perfect solitude and retirement.</p>
				<div class="bquoteClose">&nbsp;</div>
				<p class="bquote gapBelow">Swami Yatiswarananda&nbsp;who has been in charge of the Ramakrishna Ashrama in&nbsp;Bombay&nbsp;for nearly the last two years has come over to take charge of the Math and Mission in&nbsp;Madras. He has spent eight years of his monastic life in South India and has an intimate knowledge of several of its parts. He is the late editor of the&nbsp;Prabuddha Bharata&nbsp;and is well-known for his scholarship and literary abilities. He was also intimately connected with the editorial work and the publication of the&nbsp;Vedanta Kesari&nbsp;for a long period. Our Journal will appear under his editorship from May next. All official correspondence must hereafter be addressed to him. We pray to the Lord to crown his work with complete success.</p>
				<p>From May 1928 onwards, The Vedanta Kesari started printing the names of the editors. It would mention both the names (president of Madras Math and the actual editor) as 'Editors'. September 1993 onwards, nomenclature was changed over to 'Managing Editor &amp; Editor'</p>
