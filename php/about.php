			<p class="h1">Background &amp; Inspiration</p>
			<p>Under the inspiration of Swami Vivekananda, a group of his disciples in Madras, including G. Venkataranga Rao, M.C. Nanjunda Rao and Alasinga Perumal, started on 14 September 1895 a monthly journal bearing the title Brahmavadin. It continued to be brought out regularly for 14 years, until Alasinga’s demise in 1909. From 1909 to 1914, the publication of Brahmavadin became quite irregular. The last issue was brought out in 1914 (March-April).  Soon after, the Brahmavadin’s legacy was continued by a new journal, The Vedanta Kesari, started by Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai, and has been in circulation ever since.
			   In its 98th year, The Vedanta Kesari is one of India’s oldest religious magazines in English in circulation. It has a monthly circulation of nearly 12,000 copies of which 4000 go to public and institutional libraries across India. The magazine has its subscriber-base in 40 countries.
			   The Vedanta Kesari contains articles on Indian spiritual traditions and scriptures, mainly focusing on Vedanta as expounded by Swami Vivekananda, the illustrious disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. The focus of the magazine is to promote a spiritual and matured outlook towards life. It advocates renunciation of selfish desires along with the service to others in a spirit of worshipfulness.
			   Most articles published in the The Vedanta Kesariare originally written for the magazine, though a few transcriptions of the lectures and speeches are also published.
			   The usual pattern of the contents published in the The Vedanta Kesari include editorial, articles based on the teachings and incidents in the lives of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi and Swami Vivekananda – on Vedanta, Indian culture and philosophy, self-improvement, the ideal of service and Simhavalokanam (articles from the Archives of Vedanta Kesari. There is a section on book review where latest books published in religion, philosophy, culture and self-improvement are reviewed by eminent men in the concerned fields. And also it has a news section detailing service activities carried out by world-wide centres of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission.
			   Since 1978, the magazine has been regularly bringing out an annual number dedicated to a theme (Usually the December issue). Some of its popular theme-based issues published so far are: Yoga and its Aspects, Values for the Present Age, Globalization, Religion Today, Culture and Civilization, Channeling Youth Power, Nurturing Inter – personal Relationship, Upanishads in Daily Life, Facets of Freedom (December 2010 Issue), Joy of Spirituality (December 2011 Issue), etc. Many of these numbers have later been made into books and published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai.</p>
